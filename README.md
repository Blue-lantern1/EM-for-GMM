# EM-for-GMM
Expectation Maximization (EM) Algo for Gaussian mixture modelling 

Course: EE798L: Machine Learning for Wireless Communications
– Generated 2-Dimensional dataset with 2 Gaussians with certain mean, covariance and prior probabilities.
– Coded EM and executed to update parameter estimates by fixing posterior first and updating posterior by fixing
parameters next.
– After the execution is completed for a certain lower bound, we can see the algorithm classified data matches with the
original data set.
